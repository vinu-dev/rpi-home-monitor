# Changelog

All notable changes to RPi Home Monitor are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- **SWU signing now enforced on dev builds for parity with prod** — distro default is `SWUPDATE_SIGNING ?= "1"`; `config/{rpi4b,zero2w}/local.conf` no longer override it to `"0"`; `scripts/build.sh` always passes `--sign`. Both dev and prod images now ship `/etc/swupdate-public.crt` + `/etc/swupdate-enforce` and accept only CMS-signed `.swu` bundles. The dev-vs-prod axis is now strictly debug-tweaks + dev tools — not the signing layer. Tests the signing workflow on dev hardware before promotion to prod and removes the "dev accepts anything" footgun. ADR-0014 updated with the new policy.
- **AI execution rules: "never propose weakening security"** — new section in `docs/ai/execution-rules.md` codifying the rule that AI agents must refuse insecure shortcuts (injecting authorized_keys, disabling signing, adding debug-tweaks to prod, bypassing CSRF/mTLS/signatures, etc.) and propose secure alternatives instead. Triggered by an actual instance of the agent suggesting a security-weakening "convenience option" during 1.4.0 OTA validation.

### Fixed
- **Camera `/api/ota/reboot` now actually reboots** — the dashboard's "Install & reboot" button on a paired camera previously returned `HTTP 200 {"message":"Rebooting"}` and then nothing happened, because `camera-streamer.service` runs as `User=camera` and the legacy `reboot` binary fails for that user with "Failed to unlink reboot parameter file: Read-only file system." Fixed via the existing trigger-file pattern: camera-streamer (unprivileged) writes `/var/lib/camera-ota/reboot-trigger`; new root-side `camera-ota-reboot.service`, activated by `camera-ota-reboot.path`, removes the trigger and runs `systemctl reboot`. Mirrors the install pipeline (`camera-ota-installer.{service,path}`); avoids adding polkit as a dependency just for one action. Three new unit tests cover the user-side helper (`ota_installer.trigger_reboot`).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-25

Feature release. Multi-sensor camera support — any Pi-officially-supported camera sensor (OV5647 / IMX219 / IMX477 / IMX708) works out of the box on the camera image, and the per-camera dashboard Settings page renders dropdowns built from each camera's actual reported sensor capabilities. Plus single-source-of-truth release tooling. No breaking API changes.

### Added
- **Multi-sensor camera support** ([#173](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/173) — four PRs):
  - **Yocto + boot config** ([#174](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/174)) — switched the camera image from hardcoded `dtoverlay=ov5647` to firmware `camera_auto_detect=1`. Image now ships overlays for OV5647, IMX219, IMX477, IMX708. `app/camera/config/ensure-camera-overlay.sh` rewritten as an idempotent reconciler that heals stale `/boot/config.txt` lines on every boot — critical because SWUpdate's rootfs-only OTA can never overwrite the boot partition on existing field cameras. Optional `/data/config/camera-sensor` override pins a specific sensor when needed. 13-test pytest harness covers four fixtures and the four-sensor override path.
  - **Camera-side capability discovery** ([#175](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/175)) — new `camera_streamer/sensor_info.py` identifies the connected sensor via `Picamera2.global_camera_info()` (a static method that doesn't lock the camera) and looks up its modes in a hand-curated `KNOWN_SENSOR_MODES` table. `ControlHandler.get_capabilities()` returns the live sensor + modes; heartbeat embeds the same block. Generalised the OV5647-anchored hint strings across `capture.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `faults.py`, `motion_runner.py`, `motion.py`. 27 new unit tests; 404 unit tests pass overall.
  - **Server-side capability persistence** ([#176](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/176)) — `Camera` dataclass gains `sensor_model`, `sensor_modes`, `sensor_detection_method`. `accept_heartbeat` parses the new `capabilities` block defensively (per-entry rejection of malformed modes, length cap, no clobber on garbage). `_validate_update` derives valid `(width, height)` and per-resolution max fps from the live sensor — IMX219 accepts 3280×2464 and 47 fps@1080p; OV5647 rejects both with a useful message. Pre-#175 firmware leaves the record untouched (clean fallback). 11 new tests.
  - **Dashboard per-camera Settings dropdown** ([#177](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/177)) — replaced the hardcoded `_resMaxFps` map and three-option `<select>` with Alpine `<template x-for>` rendering each camera's `sensor_modes`. New "Sensor" row above the dropdown shows the live model + mode count. Mismatch banner fires when the camera's saved resolution is no longer in its current sensor's mode list (sensor swap), auto-clamps to the closest supported mode, and prompts the user to review + save. Backward-compatible with cameras still on pre-#175 firmware.

- **Single-source-of-truth release tooling** ([#178](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/178)) — new `VERSION` file at the repo root is consumed by Yocto's `DISTRO_VERSION` and `scripts/build-swu.sh`'s fallback. `scripts/release.sh` is a five-subcommand entry point (prepare/tag/build/verify/publish) for the whole release flow. `scripts/check_version_consistency.py` runs in CI's Repo Governance job and catches drift before it ships. `RELEASE.md` documents the policy and flow.

- **Hardware-aware encoder-mode filter** ([#183](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/183)) — sensors advertise modes the silicon can capture, but the SoC's V4L2 H.264 encoder has its own ceiling. The Pi Zero 2W can't allocate buffers for 3280×2464 frames (ENOMEM on `VIDIOC_REQBUFS`), and a user picking 8 MP from the dashboard would put the streamer into a restart loop. New `camera_streamer/board_profile.py` resolves a per-board encoder ceiling via `/proc/device-tree/model`; `detect_sensor_capabilities` filters `sensor_modes` against it before exposing them. Zero 2W ~2.1 MP cap, Pi 4B/5/CM4 ~8.3 MP, conservative ~2 MP fallback for unrecognised boards. Dashboard never offers a mode the hardware can't drive end-to-end.

- **Per-camera Image Quality controls** ([#182](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/182), [#183](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/183)) — capability-driven sliders + dropdowns for Brightness, Exposure compensation, Contrast, Saturation, Sharpness, NoiseReductionMode, AwbMode in the existing Camera Settings modal. Camera reports its supported controls as `image_controls` in heartbeat capabilities; the dashboard renders only rows the sensor reports. Per-row reset (`↺`) and panel-level "Reset all to defaults". 250 ms slider debounce. Settings open at the camera's CURRENT saved values, not at libcamera defaults. Server validates each value against the advertised catalogue and pushes via the existing control channel; camera applies via `Picamera2.set_controls` with no streamer restart. Replaces the reverted runtime-tweaks workaround from the .115 focus diagnosis.

### Changed
- **OV5647-specific hint strings generalised** across `capture.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `faults.py`, `motion_runner.py`, `motion.py` — now reference all four supported sensors instead of OV5647 only. The detection-error log lines point at `dmesg | grep -iE 'imx219|ov5647|imx477|imx708'` instead of `lsmod | grep ov5647`.

- **Camera Settings modal opens at saved state** ([#183](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/183)) — bitrate input cap raised from 8 → 12 Mbps so high-mode cameras' saved values are no longer visibly clamped to "8" when the modal opens (the user-reported "Settings shows GUI defaults instead of saved values" symptom). Dropdowns + sliders now reflect the camera's CURRENT persisted config when the modal opens, including the new Image Quality panel.

### Fixed
- **PR [#92](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/92)'s incidental partial IMX219 add** is now complete. The IMX219 driver and overlay shipped in the image but no path activated them, so an IMX219 camera reported "camera missing" with a `Picamera2() → IndexError` loop in the journal. End-to-end fix landed across the four PRs above; verified in-session on three live cameras (one pre-deployment with the manual hand-patch on `.186` IMX219, `.115` IMX219, `.148` OV5647 ZeroCam — confirmed firmware auto-detect works for both EEPROM-carrying and EEPROM-less boards).

### Known follow-up
- **LUKS post-pair migration** (issue [#101](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/101) + ADR-0010) still deferred from 1.3.1. `/data` ships raw ext4. Stolen SD card exposes recordings + WiFi credentials + admin hash. Targeted for 1.4.1 with hardware validation, not bundled into 1.4.0 because the safe-shipping mitigations (feature-flag gating, atomic snapshot+rollback, container-loopback test wiring, post-OTA initramfs propagation, dropbear/Plymouth unlock for the server) are larger than the rest of this release combined and cannot be hardware-validated without risk of dev-camera data loss.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-22

Patch release. Fixes the prod first-boot hotspot chain, cameraless
Pi Zero 2W detection, a UX cluster around hardware faults, and
adds a brand mark. No breaking API changes.

### Added
- **Unified fault framework** (ADR-0023, [#158](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/158)) — structured `hardware_faults: [{code, severity, message, hint, context}]` on every heartbeat. Dashboard renders one compact severity-colored chip per active fault next to the ONLINE pill; hover reveals the actionable hint. Codes this release: `camera_sensor_missing`, `camera_h264_unsupported`. Flat v1.3.0 `hardware_ok`/`hardware_error` kept for back-compat.
- **Brand mark** ([bc9d6a5](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/commit/bc9d6a5)) — new house-with-camera-aperture SVG logo in coral→violet gradient. Replaces the generic DSLR silhouette in the nav; same asset drives the favicon. Monochrome + favicon variants shipped.
- **Edit camera name + location** ([#157](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/157), [#156](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/156)) — Camera Settings modal now exposes name + location at the top. After pairing, operators can rename "Camera 1" → "Front Door" without an SSH round-trip.
- **README hero image** ([c505cd3](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/commit/c505cd3)) — marketing banner at the top of the repo landing page.

### Fixed
- **Prod first-boot hotspot never came up** ([#153](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/153), [#155](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/155)) — two stacked bugs on prod images: `luks-first-boot.sh` never shipped in the rootfs (LUKS_ENABLED scoping bug) and the wks left `/data` raw. Fixed by formatting `/data` as ext4 at image-build time in `home-{camera,monitor}-ab-luks.wks`; LUKS migration now sequences post-pairing in a follow-up slice.
- **Cameraless Pi Zero 2W reported hardware_ok=true** ([#158](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/158)) — `/dev/video10-31` exist as libcamera subdevices regardless of sensor presence, and `dtoverlay=ov5647` registers `/dev/video14` as a Video Capture node even with the ribbon cable unplugged. `CaptureManager.check()` now chains `v4l2-ctl` Device Caps (`Video Capture` only) with `libcamera-hello --list-cameras` as the authoritative probe.
- **"All systems normal — 3/3 online"** shown even when paired cameras had no sensor attached. Tier-1 summary now counts active faults into the state: amber for warning/error, red for critical.
- **LED was dark during LUKS first-boot** ([#153](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/153)) — added a fast-blink (200 ms) LED state during cryptsetup so operators know the device is working.

### Changed
- **Build checksum aligned** ([#151](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/151)) — `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` for AGPL-3.0-only now matches poky scarthgap's bundled file (`73f1eb20517c…`). Previous `eb1e6478…` was the upstream/FSF copy and failed `populate_lic_qa` on build.
- **python3-videodev2 recipe** ([#152](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/152)) — declares `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` so scarthgap's `do_populate_lic` QA stops failing the camera-prod build.
- **E2E regression spec** ([#149](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/149)) — `waitForURL(/dashboard/)` before navigating onward (login was racing the redirect); stale "Device Info / Connection" selectors replaced with `nav[aria-label="Page sections"]`-backed role queries. Yocto Runtime job now installs pytest.

### Known follow-up
- **LUKS-post-pair migration** — re-key `/data` to LUKS on the next boot after pairing completes (reopens the security posture temporarily relaxed by the wks fix). Tracked as ADR follow-up.
- **/faults page + mute endpoint** — deferred per ADR-0023 §Scope.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-21

Feature release: camera-side motion detection, admin password reset,
expanded recordings + storage controls, control-channel mTLS
hardening, and a mobile-UI polish pass. No breaking API changes.

### Added
- **Camera-side motion detection + motion recording mode** (ADR-0021, [#92](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/92)) — new on-device motion pipeline. Recording modes are now `continuous` / `motion` / `off`; motion mode writes clips only around detected events (with a configurable pre-roll + sensitivity). Exposed per-camera in the dashboard Stream Settings modal.
- **Dashboard camera details panel + motion toggle** ([#124](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/124), [#110](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/110), [#106](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/106)) — collapsible `<details>` per paired-camera card showing recording mode, firmware, bitrate/profile/keyframe, uptime, and admin-only Health rows. Motion detection checkbox + sensitivity slider wired into the stream-settings modal. New `DELETE /api/v1/recordings` endpoint with a two-step Danger Zone UI to wipe every clip across every camera.
- **Admin password reset — slice 1** (ADR-0022, [#103](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/103)) — admins can force-reset any user's password from Settings → Users with a strict-mode confirmation dialog. Sole-admin safety rail prevents demoting/clearing the only admin. Reset-token self-service flow deferred to a later slice.
- **USB reformat for all device states** ([#125](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/125), [#107](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/107)) — Format button previously appeared only for unsupported filesystems. Now: Reformat available for supported-but-not-in-use drives and for the currently-active drive (client auto-ejects before the format request). Dialog copy adapts per state.
- **Recordings Tier-2 / Tier-3 endpoints** — `GET /api/v1/recordings/latest` (newest clip across every camera) and `GET /api/v1/recordings/recent?limit=N` (most-recent N), used by dashboard surfaces.

### Changed
- **Control-channel mTLS tightened** (ADR-0015, [#122](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/122), partial [#119](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/119)) — camera status server now loads the pairing CA (`ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL` + `load_verify_locations(ca.crt)`), and `_has_mtls_client_cert` accepts only validated peer certs. The source-IP fallback was removed so an attacker on the same LAN can't impersonate the server. Pre-pairing, the listener still accepts CERT_NONE with a warning until the CA lands.
- **Yocto license labels aligned to AGPL** ([#122](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/122), [#120](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/120)) — `monitor-server_1.0.bb` and `camera-streamer_1.0.bb` now declare `LICENSE = "AGPL-3.0-only"` with the upstream `COMMON_LICENSE_DIR` checksum.
- **Mobile Recordings layout + date-picker width** ([#123](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/123), [#104](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/104), [#105](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/105)) — Recordings player capped at 38vh on narrow viewports so the list remains reachable. Date / datetime-local inputs get a sensible min/max width. Clip-card checkbox hit area expanded to 44×44 per WCAG 2.5.5 while the visual remains 18px.
- **Camera Status page tap-target polish** ([#123](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/123), [#109](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/109)) — TOC links padded to ≥44px with `touch-action: manipulation` to kill the iOS 300ms tap delay.
- **Live View height cap** ([#98](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/98), [#97](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/97)) — player capped at 70vh with player controls; fits laptop viewports without scrolling.
- **Dashboard "N recent system events" strip** ([#102](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/102)) — now clears when the user visits `/logs` instead of hanging around until page reload.
- **Server-deploy script now ships `reset-admin-password.py`** ([#108](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/108)) under `/opt/monitor/scripts/` so on-device recovery uses the same code the CI tests exercise.
- **Release planning + local-first roadmap docs landed** (`docs/roadmap-next-2-releases.md`, `docs/specs/r1-*.md`).

### Fixed
- **Motion-mode recordings — clip spawning race** ([#94](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/94)) — scheduler now wakes on motion event + correlator accepts clips that start just after the event timestamp.
- **Fresh-camera stream-state default** (ADR-0017, [#126](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/126), [#115](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/115)) — `lifecycle._read_desired_stream_state` defaulted to `running` for a missing state file, drifting from `control.py`'s `stopped`. Aligned to `stopped` per ADR-0017 on-demand; regression test locks parity with ControlHandler.
- **Safety-rail AttributeError on admin password reset** ([#122](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/122), [#117](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/117)) — `UserService` called the non-existent `self._store.list_users()`; renamed to `get_users()` with a regression test that instantiates a real `Store` (not a MagicMock) so future renames fail loudly.
- **Nightly Validation** ([#149](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/149)) — 5+ consecutive red runs. Fixed the Browser E2E Full login race (waitForURL before navigating onward), refreshed stale camera-status section labels, and installed `pytest` in the Yocto Runtime job.
- **Mobile UI + storage triage** ([#93](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/93)) — covers [#86](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/86), [#87](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/87), [#88](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/88), [#89](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/89); confirms [#91](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/91); partial [#90](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/90).

### Security
- ADR-0022 ("no backdoors") codified. The earlier sudo-only CLI admin-recovery script was removed end-to-end in [#111](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/111); sole-admin lockout is now a hardware-only recovery path. Every auth/recovery PR in this release cites ADR-0022.
- Camera control-channel source-IP fallback removed (see Changed above).

### Known follow-up
- Server→camera direction still uses `ssl.CERT_NONE` because the camera's status-server cert is self-signed; closing this needs an ADR picking CA-signed-at-pairing vs pinned fingerprint. Tracked in [#119](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/119).
- Self-service forgot-password (reset-token) flow deferred to a future slice of [#99](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/99).
- Secrets-at-rest ([#101](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/issues/101)) needs its own ADR before implementation.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-04-19

Quality-and-polish patch. No API changes, no migration needed.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Recent events too long** ([#82](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/82)) — the feed rendered 8 rows, filling the viewport and making the dashboard feel like a recordings page in miniature. Dropped to 3 rows; header "All recordings →" link is the path to the full timeline.
- **Dashboard Recent activity silently empty** ([#82](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/82)) — the x-show gate `auditAdmin && auditEvents.length > 0` collapsed the section during the render tick when `auditEvents` was an empty array (initial state before the async fetch resolved). Gated on `auditAdmin` alone now, with an explicit "No recent activity yet." empty state when the list is genuinely empty.
- **WHEP proxy `AttributeError` on headerless `HTTPError`** ([#81](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/81)) — `api/webrtc.py` used `hasattr(e, "headers")` which returns True even when `e.headers is None`. Switched to `if e.headers is not None`.
- **`subprocess` import in `api/ota.py`** ([#81](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/81)) — architecture fitness tests flagged the API layer calling `subprocess.run` directly. Moved reboot scheduling to `OTAService.schedule_reboot()`; same delay, same thread name, same behaviour.

### Added
- **World-class test suite** ([#81](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/81)) — 1585 server tests + 555 camera tests (was ~1280 server). 86 → 87.8% server coverage. Adds architecture fitness tests (AST rules for CSRF on mutating routes, M2M HMAC, Store-import layering), property-based tests via Hypothesis for auth + crypto, Playwright regression journeys, and mutation testing (gated behind `vars.RUN_SERVER_MUTATION`).
- **Unified `logged_in_client` fixture** ([#81](https://github.com/vinu-dev/rpi-home-monitor/pull/81)) — replaces 13 duplicate `_login` helpers across the integration suite.

### Known follow-up
- Schemathesis fuzzing exposed ~33 pre-existing OpenAPI-vs-implementation gaps in the API contract. Reverted fuzzing to `examples` phase for v1.2.1; full fix tracked for a later contract-hardening PR.
- `browser-e2e-full` job pulled — journey specs written without a live seeded server had guessed selectors. Smoke project still runs.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-19

First commercial release. Bundles the OTA production-hardening work
(signed bundles, dual-transport install, dashboard performance) with
a round of release-readiness security fixes.

### Added
- **Production Yocto build targets** — `scripts/build.sh server-prod` and `camera-prod` now consume `config/<board>/local.conf.prod` which `require`s the dev config and flips `SWUPDATE_SIGNING = "1"` (see ADR-0014). Dev paths unchanged.
- **Pre-upload `.swu` inspection in both GUIs** — browser reads the CPIO header + sw-description text before sending, rejecting unsigned bundles and cross-target bundles (server .swu dropped on the camera card and vice versa) at selection time.
- **`/etc/sw-versions` stamped at install time** — `post-update.sh` parses the bundle version and writes it into the new slot so the "Current version" UI line reflects what's running, instead of the Yocto-baked `1.0.0`.
- **`must_change_password` enforced server-side** — flagged sessions get `403 must_change_password: true` from every protected endpoint; allow-list covers password-change, logout, and `/me`.
- **`requirements.lock`** — exact-version pin file for deterministic server installs (Flask 3.1.3, bcrypt 5.0.0, Jinja2 3.1.6, zeroconf 0.148.0 + transitive pins).
- **USB "In use" state** — active backing device shows the badge + eject hint instead of a clickable Use button.
- **`build-swu.sh` post-substitution check** — aborts if any `@@PLACEHOLDER@@` markers survived sed substitution.
- **Recordings page supports flat-layout clips** — loop-recorder clips (`<cam>/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4`) now listable via `get_dates_with_clips`, `list_clips`, `get_clip_path`.
- **Signed-OTA validation record** — `docs/exec-plans/ota-signing-validation-2026-04-19.md` captures the 6/6 on-hardware tests.

### Changed
- **OTA bundle staging is atomic** — `shutil.move` swapped for `os.replace` via a per-request temp path. Concurrent uploads against the same filename no longer risk corruption.
- **`SECRET_KEY` persistence fails loudly** — if `$CONFIG_DIR/.secret_key` can't be written we raise `RuntimeError` rather than returning an ephemeral key that rotates on restart.
- **Dashboard tab-switching is instant again** — `<video>` elements in Recent Events only materialise after Play click (`x-if`, not `x-show`); `latest_across_cameras` / `recent_across_cameras` cache `rglob` results for 20 s.
- **Retention estimate cached 5 min** — `_estimate_retention_days` was walking `/data/recordings` every 10 s from the dashboard poll.

### Fixed
- `must_change_password` API-bypass (client-side flag only).
- `SECRET_KEY` silent reset on write failure.
- `shutil.move` staging race under concurrent OTA uploads.
- `build-swu.sh` shipping unresolved `@@NAME@@` placeholders on drift.
- Recordings tab empty when only flat-layout clips exist.
- Dashboard → live navigation stall (3-minute delay in field testing).
- USB Storage "Use" button clickable for active device.

### Security
- CMS/PKCS7 signed `.swu` bundles accepted by server + camera installers (ADR-0014). Unsigned + tampered bundles rejected before any write.
- `/etc/swupdate-enforce` marker + `-k cert` in `swupdate -c` give dual-defense; missing cert on a signing-enforced image is a hard fail.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Dual-transport OTA, end-to-end validated** (ADR-0020) — three install paths now work on hardware:
  - Server self-upload + install via admin Settings → Updates tab.
  - Server → camera push via admin Cameras tab (uploads bundle to server inbox, relays over mTLS to the camera's :8080 OTAAgent).
  - Camera-direct upload via the camera's own status page (:443 Updates section) for admins on the LAN with the camera's password.
- **Privilege-separated camera installer** — a root-owned `camera-ota-installer.service` activated by a systemd `.path` unit watching `/var/lib/camera-ota/trigger`. Keeps `camera-streamer` unprivileged (`NoNewPrivileges=true`) while still letting OTA writes to `/dev/mmcblk0p2/3`, `fw_setenv`, and `/dev` symlinks happen with the permissions SWUpdate needs.
- **Shared installer module** `camera_streamer.ota_installer` consumed by both transports (`ota_agent.py` on :8080 and the new :443 status-server routes). Single source of truth for stage/trigger/poll. 15 unit tests + integration coverage.
- **Camera Updates UI** — collapsible section on the camera status page with file picker, upload progress, install-state display, and Reboot button. Streams directly to `/api/ota/upload` — the handler never buffers the 128 MB bundle in RAM.
- **Boot-time `/dev/monitor_standby` service** — creates the symlink against the current `boot_slot` at `Before=sysinit.target`, so SWUpdate's `check_free_space` sees the real 2 GiB partition instead of tmpfs and stops rejecting valid installs.
- **mDNS server discovery** — Server advertises itself as `homemonitor.local` via Avahi. Cameras auto-discover the server without needing a manual IP address. Camera setup page defaults to `homemonitor.local`.
- **Captive portal provisioning** — Both server and camera trigger the phone's "Sign in to network" popup on hotspot connect. Supports iOS, Android, Windows, Firefox, and Samsung captive portal detection. Manual fallback at `http://10.42.0.1` always works.
- **LED status feedback** — Onboard ACT LED shows device state:
  - Slow blink (1s) = setup mode, waiting for WiFi config
  - Fast blink (200ms) = connecting to WiFi
  - Very fast blink (100ms) = error, connection failed
  - Solid on = running normally
  - Off = service stopped
- **WiFi rescan button** — Camera setup page can re-scan for networks (briefly drops hotspot).
- **Avahi service file** for server — advertises `_homemonitor._tcp`, `_https._tcp`, and `_http._tcp` services.
- **First-boot hostname** — Server hostname set to `homemonitor` on first boot for mDNS reachability.

### Fixed
- **OTA: camera `sw-description` hardware key** — was `raspberrypi0-2w-64` but `/etc/hwrevision` on the camera image is `home-monitor-camera`. Mismatch caused `swupdate -c` to reject every camera bundle.
- **OTA: post-boot health check probed auth-protected URLs** — `swupdate-check.sh` used `wget` against `/api/v1/ota/status` on the server and a wrong port on the camera. Both returned 401/404, which `wget` treats as failure — so upgrade_available stayed at 1 and U-Boot eventually rolled back a working install. Replaced with a `curl`-based `http_alive()` that accepts any HTTP response (any status ≠ 000 proves the port bound), with 12×5s retry to cover Type=simple service startup race, and pointed the camera probe at the status server on :443.
- **OTA: `swupdate-check.service` stuck behind `network-online.target`** — the Yocto image ships `systemd-networkd-wait-online` enabled, but WiFi is managed by NetworkManager, so networkd has no interfaces and times out, never letting `network-online.target` reach ready. Changed the unit to `After=network.target` (localhost is enough) and bumped `TimeoutStartSec` to 180 s.
- **OTA: camera `ProtectSystem=strict` blocked the spool directory** — `camera-streamer` only had `ReadWritePaths=/data`, but the OTA spool lives at `/var/lib/camera-ota` by design (shared with the privileged installer via tmpfiles.d). Streamer got EROFS staging uploaded bundles. Added the spool dir to the unit's writable paths.
- **OTA: server-push OOM-killed the camera** — the first OTAAgent implementation held the mTLS HTTPS connection open while `swupdate` wrote 1.8 GB to the SD card. On the Pi Zero 2W (362 MB RAM) this pushed the kernel past OOM — camera-streamer, sshd, and getty were all killed and the box needed a physical power cycle. Made the upload handler return 202 Accepted as soon as the trigger file is written; the server polls `/ota/status` for progress. Matches the camera-direct GUI flow that was already stable.
- **OTA: server install picked a stale staged bundle** — `install_server_image()` used `os.listdir()[0]`, which returns filesystem order on Linux. A leftover bundle from a prior aborted install (`server-update-1.1.0-feat-ota-dual.swu`) beat the freshly uploaded one lexicographically (`'1' < 'd'`), so the user's upload was silently ignored and an old version installed. Now picks the newest `.swu` by mtime.
- **OTA: `/dev/monitor_standby` symlink missing on some boots** — the boot-time service runs `Before=sysinit.target` when `/boot` (home of `u-boot.env`) isn't reliably mounted, so `fw_printenv boot_slot` sometimes returned the wrong slot and the symlink pointed at the running partition, tripping SWUpdate's `check_free_space` on the next install. The privileged installer now refreshes the symlink itself before invoking swupdate — no longer relies on the boot service being timely.
- **Hotspot startup race condition** — `nmcli connection up` was called before wlan0 was ready at boot, causing "No suitable device found" error. Now waits for WiFi interface readiness (up to 30s) and retries activation (5 attempts). Explicit `ifname wlan0` passed to prevent NM from trying eth0.
- **NGINX HTTP redirect loop** — Setup wizard was inaccessible because HTTP 80 redirected to HTTPS 443, but TLS certs don't exist during first boot. HTTP now serves directly.
- **Camera WiFi scan** — Scan button now triggers a real WiFi rescan instead of showing cached results.

### Changed
- Server and camera systemd services now depend on `sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device` to ensure WiFi hardware is ready.
- Server hotspot service has `TimeoutStartSec=90` to allow for WiFi retry loop.
- Camera setup page server address field defaults to `homemonitor.local` instead of empty.

## [v1.0.6-dev] — 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Camera password authentication** — Camera status page now requires login with username/password set during provisioning. PBKDF2-SHA256 hashing (100k iterations, random 16-byte salt). Session-based auth with HttpOnly cookies and 2-hour timeout.
- **Camera setup collects credentials** — First-boot wizard now asks for admin username and password.
- **Camera `.local` URL access** — Cameras are reachable via mDNS at `http://rpi-divinu-cam-XXXX.local` (XXXX = last 4 hex of CPU serial).
- **Camera system health display** — Status page shows CPU temperature, memory usage, and uptime with color-coded thresholds.
- **Camera WiFi change** — Authenticated users can change WiFi network and password from the status page.
- **Camera password change** — Authenticated users can change the camera admin password.
- **25 new tests** — 8 for password management, 17 for session management, provisioning, and system helpers.

### Fixed
- **Server settings WiFi card hidden** — Race condition where `auth.getMe()` async call hadn't completed before settings `init()` checked user role.
- **Server settings uptime `[object Object]`** — API returns `{seconds, display}` object; JS was displaying the raw object.
- **Server settings disk "0 B"** — API returns `disk.total_gb`; JS was using `data.disk.total` (undefined).

### Changed
- **Camera templates extracted** — Inline HTML moved from `wifi_setup.py` to separate template files in `templates/`.
- Camera unique hostname set during first boot via CPU serial suffix for multi-device mDNS support.

## Setup Guide

### Part 1: Server Setup (RPi 4B)

1. **Power on** — Insert SD card, plug in power, wait ~60 seconds. LED starts slow blinking (setup mode).
2. **Connect to hotspot** — On your phone, connect to WiFi `HomeMonitor-Setup` (password: `homemonitor`).
3. **Setup wizard opens automatically** — Your phone should show a "Sign in to network" popup. If not, open `http://10.42.0.1` in a browser.
4. **Configure WiFi** — Select your home WiFi network, enter password, hit Connect.
5. **Set admin password** — Change the default admin password (minimum 8 characters).
6. **Complete setup** — Hit Complete. The server stops the hotspot and joins your home WiFi. LED goes solid (connected). You will lose connection to the hotspot — this is normal.
7. **Reconnect** — Connect your phone back to your home WiFi.
8. **Open dashboard** — Go to `https://homemonitor.local` (accept the self-signed cert warning). If `.local` doesn't resolve on your network, find the server IP from your router's DHCP table.
9. **Log in** — Username: `admin`, Password: what you set in step 5.

### Part 2: Camera Setup (RPi Zero 2W)

1. **Attach camera** — Connect PiHut ZeroCam ribbon cable (blue side faces the board).
2. **Power on** — Insert SD card, plug in power, wait ~90 seconds (Zero 2W is slower). LED starts slow blinking (setup mode).
3. **Connect to hotspot** — On your phone, connect to WiFi `HomeCam-Setup` (password: `homecamera`).
4. **Setup wizard opens automatically** — Your phone shows the "Sign in to network" popup. If not, open `http://10.42.0.1` in a browser.
5. **Configure WiFi** — Select your home WiFi network, enter password.
6. **Server address** — Leave as `rpi-divinu.local` (auto-discovery). Only change this if mDNS doesn't work on your network — in that case enter the server's IP address. Port: leave as `8554`.
7. **Set camera login** — Choose a username (default: `admin`) and password (min 4 characters). You'll need these to access the camera's settings page later.
8. **Save & Connect** — LED switches to fast blink (connecting), then solid on (connected). The hotspot disappears. A `.local` URL is shown (e.g., `http://rpi-divinu-cam-d8ee.local`) — bookmark it for future access. If connection fails, LED blinks rapidly and the hotspot restarts automatically for retry.

### Part 3: Pair Camera on Server

1. **Reconnect** — Connect your phone back to your home WiFi.
2. **Open dashboard** — Go to `https://homemonitor.local` and log in.
3. **Confirm camera** — The camera appears as "pending" on the Dashboard (wait up to 30 seconds, refresh if needed). Click it and hit Confirm. Give it a name and location.
4. **Streaming starts** — HLS live view + 3-minute MP4 clips begin recording automatically.

### LED Quick Reference

| LED Pattern | Server | Camera |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Slow blink (1s on/off) | Setup mode — hotspot active, waiting for WiFi config | Same |
| Fast blink (200ms) | — | Connecting to WiFi |
| Very fast blink (100ms) | — | WiFi connection failed, retrying |
| Solid on | Running normally | Running normally, streaming to server |
| Off | Service stopped | Service stopped |

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Captive portal doesn't pop up | Open `http://10.42.0.1` manually in your browser |
| `homemonitor.local` doesn't resolve | Use the server's IP address from your router's DHCP table instead |
| Camera can't find server | Enter the server IP manually instead of `homemonitor.local` during camera setup |
| Hotspot doesn't appear | Wait 60-90 seconds after power on. Check LED — slow blink means hotspot is active |
| LED stays off after boot | Service may have failed. Connect via SSH and check `journalctl -u monitor-hotspot` (server) or `journalctl -u camera-streamer` (camera) |
